# Changelog

## 0.8.1

- Keep the open design out of STATE. A design is now checkout-local interactive state in the checkout's own Git directory (`haeram-interactive.json`, written by `vibe design start|end`): STATE travels with every planning commit and `vibe plan-push` to the planning branch and into every worktree, so a `## design` line there could reach unrelated worktrees and stop their push, preflight and loop. `vibe status`, `vibe push`, preflight and `vibe loop` read the local state, so only the designing checkout is held. Starting a design leaves the working tree clean.
- Common rule 2 asks before committing or pushing when `vibe status` reports `design`. FORMAT moves the design rules from State rules to Sessions; the STATE skeleton no longer has `## design`, and lint warns when a 0.8.0 `## design` section remains.

## 0.8.0

- Add `start-design`, a pair-only live design mode. It marks the checkout as designing in a new optional STATE section `## design` (`- since:<ISO UTC> | tag:<tag> | scope:<text>`, kept uncommitted next to the edits), keeps a hot-reload dev server up and edits code exactly as the user describes — no tests, e2e, task files, SSOT edits, commits or pushes while the design is open. When the user says the design is finished it runs every test, then makes one commit with the design, its test updates and STATE log `- YYMMDD design <area>: <what>`.
- Add `vibe design start|verify|end` (plain `vibe design` reports the open design). `start` resumes a design left open by an earlier conversation with its own since and tag. `verify` runs every ARCH task and batch command once on the uncommitted working tree at the batch tier, under the heavy lock and check cache; fast checks run first and a failure there skips the slow suites. `--verify <command>` overrides the batch commands.
- Every skill now asks whether the design is finished before any commit or push while STATE `## design` exists (common rule 2). `vibe status` reports `design` and routes `design` first; start-vibe asks the user in pair and parks it in autopilot. `vibe push` refuses, autopilot preflight fails with a needs-user `design` check and `vibe loop` stops while a design is open. STATE merges union the design section; lint checks one well-formed design line.

## 0.7.7

- Make one planning branch (STATE cfg `plan`, default `main`) the home of every task ID and planning document, whichever checkout or worktree plans. `vibe plan-sync` merges its latest before planning; `vibe plan-push` replays spec-only planning commits onto it (pushed when the remote has the branch, independent of cfg push; otherwise the clean local branch is fast-forwarded) and merges the result back so later task archiving cannot resurrect published tasks. A T### another checkout published first is refused with the colliding files, and the losing checkout renumbers. Commits touching code are refused. `plan: -` keeps the previous single-checkout behavior.

## 0.7.6

- Make start-vibe's default final verification coordinator-owned: workers and reviewers run affected unit tests and fast checks, units collect locally, and one host runs integration/e2e/full suites on the integrated candidate before the target-branch push. Align existing-group migration, skill handoffs and runner examples. Per-unit loop publication now requires explicit `--push-each-unit`; strict-mode `vibe claim` shares only ownership metadata on the remote tree while keeping pending code local.
- Automatically lock batch/group checks, recheck cached passes inside the lock, reject delegated final checks unless explicitly overridden with `--allow-final`, and fail final checks when the committed candidate changes. Guard pushes with `--verified-commit` so remote synchronization cannot silently publish unverified changes.

## 0.7.5

- Archive fully converted ideation documents under `spec/ideation/done/` and remove their STATE rows. Partial conversion stays ready; both create-ssot and update-ssot compare the adopted scope against the actual SSOTs before archiving. Preserve unresolved work in an active follow-up document.
- Lint ideation status, skeletons, domain mappings, unresolved items and archive/STATE conflicts. Keep inbox references valid across archival, accept legacy unmarked domains as adopted, and warn when legacy converted documents still need moving. Archived discussions are historical records rather than current planning inputs.

## 0.7.3

- Track runner integration failures and bounded transient retries by submission ID (or submitted commit), allowing repaired and reapproved attempts to integrate in the same run without repeatedly retrying a failed submission. Applies to Claude, Codex and command adapters.
- When approved submissions cannot integrate and no jobs remain, return `needs-attention` with their attempt IDs instead of waiting on unrelated decisions. Log decision-wait targets, questions and deadlines to stderr and runtime history.
- Default autopilot decision waits to 15 minutes (900000ms); explicit `--decision-wait-ms` still takes precedence. Pair mode keeps its immediate return for unanswered decisions so the user can decide; its unused two-hour wait default remains for compatibility. Coordinators resume immediately after a planning commit and express ordering through task dependencies and notes.

## 0.7.2

- Autopilot resolves reversible planning decisions through the planning skills and records its choices instead of waiting for a user. Blocked tasks receive a fresh recovery unit; CI failures queue a prioritized repair and continue within the configured limits. Persist pending repairs and final CI evidence for resumption.
- Task sessions run affected unit tests and fast checks. Integration/e2e suites run at the target-branch push or final completion gate, with one CI wait per code batch and explicit records of deferred checks.
- The publishing workflow runs its release gate once, avoiding a second identical run through the npm publish lifecycle.
- Remove target-project details from reusable instructions and examples; anonymize historical measurement identifiers. Document project independence for both coding agents.

## 0.7.1

- create-task: shared helpers and types get one common location named in impl notes (and in that task's touches), later tasks point to them by name; tunable values are written as config names, with the number only in the task that defines the config. Applies to solo work too, not only work-group foundations.
- implement-task: search for an existing helper/type/config before writing a new one; solo work may move a helper to a shared file outside touches (noted in limits), workers reuse or note it; read tunables through their config. Before the commit, skim the task's own diff for redefinitions, literal numbers that have a config, unread configs/exports, stale comments and repeated expressions.
- review-task: those same points are findings.

## 0.7.0

- One brief assembler for `vibe brief` (standalone) and `work brief` (work groups, runner, `vibe loop`): the task; the current rules of each cited domain (STATE cfg `brief: domain`, the default) or only the cited decisions (`brief: cited`); what they require (`→!`) or delegate to (`→=`), transitively; decisions that reference a cited one; the global rules (cfg `always`, default every ARCH decision); the flow·constraints of each domain it draws from; chg lines after a stale base; the inbox lines about it. Whole blocks, never cut to a size.
- Reference kinds in FORMAT: `→!` requires, `→=` canonical, `→~` related, `→` unclassified (every existing reference). Unclassified references are followed one hop from a block the task depends on and listed beyond it; `/` lists, `–` ranges, whole-domain `→ID` and bare IDs are parsed. Existing SSOTs are not reclassified.
- `vibe brief` takes `T###`, `ID-n` (with referrers), `ID` and `ID@rev` (history since rev), `--ref <commit>` and `--deep`; it prints markdown ending in an `end … chars:N` line (`--json` for data) and exits 1 when incomplete. Provenance: source (working tree with HEAD and dirty spec files, or one commit), domain path·rev·sha256, block path·lines·sha256.
- `decisionBlocks` keeps every line up to the next top-level bullet or heading (unindented tables and continuation lines were dropped before).
- lint: broken typed references are errors, broken unclassified ones and canonical cycles warnings, the unclassified count a review hint; cfg `always` entries must exist and cfg `brief` is `domain` or `cited`.
- create-task cites every decision a task's implementation must obey, so a project can move to `brief: cited` (measured on a 13-SSOT project: `cited` answered 13 of 25 policy questions on existing tasks, `domain` all 25).
- Skills read decisions through the brief; completeness is per block and per brief (`end` line, complete:yes) instead of "the doc's `## chg` is visible". Built-in adapters pass the brief to the model as markdown; adapter payloads keep the JSON shape.

## 0.6.0

- Add `vibe loop`: serial fresh Claude/Codex sessions, single-unit results, one preflight/report/tag, bounded retries and work/time limits, stop markers, detached hosts and persistent logs/session IDs.
- Add `vibe ci wait` and `vibe push --wait-ci`: CLI-owned waiting with backoff, authenticated gh/token API or public HTML, exact commit checks, bounded no-run handling and workflow path filters. No anonymous API polling.
- Add standalone `vibe brief` and scoped FORMAT excerpts; summarize STATE and test output, retain full check logs and persist the task-start diff base.
- Default to task checks, one batch gate before a code push and CI after push; understand ARCH task/batch/CI decision sub-lines and flag missing tiers as review hints.
- Keep task commits while batching solo pushes/reports; retain strict remote claims with other sessions. Allow small bug/wording/style fixes without a task file under explicit size and policy limits.
- Shorten common skills and load work-group/pair details only when needed. Preserve the existing work runner and installer lock format for both agents.
